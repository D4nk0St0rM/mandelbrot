The Mandelbrot set is an example of a fractal in mathematics. It is named after Beno√Æt Mandelbrot, a Polish-French-American mathematician.  The Mandelbrot set is important for chaos theory. The edging of the set shows a self-similarity, which is perfect, but because of the minute detail, it looks like it evens out. The Mandelbrot set can be explained with the equation z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c.
