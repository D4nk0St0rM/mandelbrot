### [mandelbrot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D4nk0St0rM/various_python_maths_science/main/mandlebrot.py)

The Mandelbrot set is an example of a fractal in mathematics. It is named after Beno√Æt Mandelbrot, a Polish-French-American mathematician.  The Mandelbrot set is important for chaos theory. The edging of the set shows a self-similarity, which is perfect, but because of the minute detail, it looks like it evens out. The Mandelbrot set can be explained with the equation z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c. 


### [quantum states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D4nk0St0rM/various_python/main/quantum_states.py)

This being part of year 1 BSc (Hons) Physics python module

- Requirements pip install periodic
- calculates the frequency and wavelength of a photon emitted or absorbed when a hydrogen-like ion changes its quantum state
- requires the user to provide the atomic number of the ion and the principal quantum number of the initial and final states
- tells the user whether the photon is emitted or absorbed.
- Calculate the energy and whether a photon is emitted or absorbed by user entry of initial and final states of an electron
- Print periodic table for reference
